English:
Customize your own turbo-charged machine and prepare to rip through futuristic environments, subterranean tunnels, abandoned canyons, and surreal post-nuclear landscapes. Link up to eight simultaneous players, just to make things more intense. But be warned: miss a hairpin turn, spin out at 180 miles an hour – make one small mistake – and you’re vapor. And there’s no going back. You’ve got to win the race or die.
